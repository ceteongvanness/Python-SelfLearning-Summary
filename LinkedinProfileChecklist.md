**Professional LinkedIn Profile Checklist**

**General**

- A custom URL has been created
- Spelling and grammar are correct
- Acronyms or language are likely to be known to recruiters or includes explanation
- Does not include negative language
- Language is correct and consistent: present tense for current duties, past tense for prior duties and accomplishments.

**Hiring Perspective**: When there are errors such as grammar or spelling mistakes, the reader's eye is instead focused on those design errors rather than the words in your profile. Employers and recruiters may perceive you as lacking attention to to detail or unprofessional.

**Tip**: To ensure that your profile is free of mistakes, try to proofread it aloud or with another person. And, don't forget to make your LinkedIn profile public, otherwise recruiters and  employers will not be able to find you when performing LinkedIn searches.



**Top Section**

- Profile includes a clear picture of student's face
- Picture needs to look professional, but does not have to be a professional portrait
- Headline uses only positing language (eg. not "seeking employment" which conveys a lack of employment)
- Headline avoids use of slashes(ie: "data analyst/data scientist")

**Hiring Perspective**: The information that you put in the headline should be clear and concise not only because you want to demonstrate focus in your professional aspirations, but to optimize your profile to show up easily in filtered online search. Recruiters and employers will often use keywords like the title of the role (example: Android Developer) to surface individuals to potentially reach out to.

**Tip**: Avoid cramming too much into your headline, because it can give the impression that you aren't focused or are unclear of the nuances in the industry. Just having "data analyst" as a headline is better than having "data analyst/data scientist/machine learning engineer" because all of those three roles are very different.

**Network**

- Is a member of 3+ relevant groups to goal position/industry
- Educational institutions and company pages are correctly linked

**Hiring Perspective**: The more quality 1st degree connections you have, the better your chances of making 2nd degree connections. Furthermore, it's important to have enough connections to show up easily in searches. Ideally, you should have more than 250 connections.

**Tip**: There is growing thread in the LinkedIn forum where you can connect with other students, If you're new to Linkedin, getting 50 connections can be daunting. Not having many connections means you will not likely show up in search results. Furthermore, if you having trouble finding groups, here is a resource to help you get started.

**Summary**

- Summary briefly describes work experience, applicable knowledge, and builds a narrative
- Written in first person
- Stays professional throughout the entire narrative
- Length is about 1-4 sentences

**Hiring Perspective**: Employers want to hire candidates who are passionate and have a personal drive related to the position. These qualities are essential in a constantly evolving field, because passion for the product or field ensures that you will do your best to remain on the cutting edge.

**Tip**: You should have a summary statement, but depending on what you're looking for and how you want to market yourself, there is no set way to do so. Generally, 1-4 sentences is a good summary because anything more is unlikely to be read.

**Project**

- Only most relevant projects are listed; can include personal, academic or work projects
- Only includes about 2-3 projects
- Projects have links leading to the code or the project itself
- Maximum 2-3 bullet points per project
  - At least 1 bullet point demonstrates individual contribution
  - At least 1 bullet point communicates project result (success metrics, findings)

**Hiring Perspective**: It's essential for you to highlight concrete project results and individual contributions because employers want to see concrete evidence of your skills.

**Tip**: Whenever you can, describe your work quantitatively. If you can't due to the nature of your work, still showcase its success, even when what you achieved wasn't what you originally intended. If you have less than 3 work experiences, try to supplement by adding another project to your Project section.

Experience

- Experiences note company/organization, title of role, start and end date (month & year), location
- Include unpaid or part-time work, if applicable, but omits the words "part-time" and "unpaid"
- Maximum 3-4 bullet points
- No sub-bullet points
- Bullet points start with action verbs
- Correct tense is used in bullet points: past tense for previous, current tense for ongoing
- Within each job listing:
  - At least 1 bullet point communicates how candidate benefited company or cause
  - At least 1 bullet point provides concrete, numerical evidence such as projects completed, money made, people managed, accomplishments (eg. % increase)
- Bullet points are one sentence maximum, not longer than one and half lines
